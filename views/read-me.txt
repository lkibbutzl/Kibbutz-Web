Usually in sass the barnched files are sytaxed as _filename.scss and the representative file as main.scss

For Compiling SCSS into CSS files..Locate to the Sass folder in the project from the "Command Line" and Type "npm run compile:sass"  .... (Only if you make any changes in the sass files.However my code is already compiled and stored in css/style.css)
